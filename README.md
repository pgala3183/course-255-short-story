DROWCULA: Dimensionally Reduced Open-World Clustering
NeurIPS 2025 Paper Presentation & Analysis
Presentable Research on: Unsupervised Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Vision Transformers, Novel Class Discovery

Paper Authors: Erencem Ozbey & Dimitrios I. Diochnos (Bogazici University & University of Oklahoma)

📋 Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive presentation, analysis, and video resources for the DROWCULA paper accepted at NeurIPS 2025. DROWCULA introduces a novel approach to open-world clustering that achieves state-of-the-art results by combining:

Vision Transformers (ViT) for rich feature extraction

Manifold Learning (UMAP) for intelligent dimensionality reduction

K-means Clustering in low-dimensional space

Bayesian Optimization for automatic cluster count discovery

Key Innovation
DROWCULA achieves fully unsupervised clustering that beats semi-supervised methods—a paradigm shift in unsupervised learning.
